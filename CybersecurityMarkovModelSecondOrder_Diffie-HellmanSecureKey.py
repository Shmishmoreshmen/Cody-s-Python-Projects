#
# Name: Cody Thompson
# Project: Markov Model Second Order
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Description: 
# In a Markov model, we assume that:
# The future state depends only on a limited number of past states.
# First-order Markov model: Next state depends only on the current state.
# Second-order Markov model: Next state depends on the two previous states.
# Example text generation:
# Letâ€™s say we want to predict the next word in a sentence using a 
# second-order Markov model. If our last two words were:

# "I am"
# A second-order model might tell us the next word has the following probabilities:

# happy: 0.6
# tired: 0.3
# leaving: 0.1
# These probabilities are learned from training on existing text.

# Diffie-Hellman secure key exchange between two parties
# Without transmitting the actual key
# Diffie-Hellman is widely used in protocols like TLS/SSL 
# for securing communications over the internet (e.g., in HTTPS).
#
# It forms the basis for other more complex cryptographic protocols 
# such as ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), which uses elliptic 
# curve mathematics for better performance and security.
#
# Key Points:
# Security: The security of Diffie-Hellman relies on the discrete 
# logarithm problem, which is difficult to solve. Even if an attacker 
# intercepts the public values and the public keys, they cannot easily 
# compute the shared secret.
# 
# Vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Without additional 
# measures (like authentication), Diffie-Hellman is vulnerable to 
# Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the public 
# keys and substitute their own, causing both parties to share a secret 
# with the attacker instead of each other.
