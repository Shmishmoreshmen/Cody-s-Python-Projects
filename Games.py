# DICE ROLLER GAME

# Project: Dice Roller Game
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# This game is a mennu driven program that will give the user
# options 1-7. Options 1-5 qill roll dice according to what menu option 
# the user selects. If the option is 1 then it will role a 4 sided dice.
# There are a totla of 5 dice to roll; 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided, and 
# a 20-sided dice. This program also saves the users dice rolls and displays them
# if the user selects option 6 from the menu.

# TEXT BASED ADVENTURE GAME

# Name: Cody Thompson
# Project: Text Based Adventure Game
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# This text based adventure game has mainly text to decide where the user wishes to go 
# or what the user is currenlty seeing. This game is based upon the decisions of the user
# to decide where they should go or what they should do if something happens.
# this game has an invitory system. The game has a treasure room that will randomly decide
# what the user can see or pick up. The game also has a dragon room that handles the dragon
# attack portion. This game also has a inventory checker that makes sure you have the right
# items for the job and if you dont then the game becomes a bit hard to Succeeded at.

# SNAKE GAME

# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# The idea beind this game is that the board will be created upon execution, then
# the user can select the difficulty from the menu that is presented to them at run time.
# Once a difficulty is selected then the game stats by having the snake move in a linear fashion
# then random red squares will appear that represent the food tokens. The user has to 
# move there snake using the arrow keys to pick p the food. Onced picked up the food token then
# turns into a segment of the snake thus extending the snakes body. Dont run into the walls on the
# sides or run into yourself as then the game will be over.

# BATTLESHIP GAME (WORK IN PROGRESS)
#
# Name: Cody Thompson
# Project: Battlteship
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# This game is still a work in progress. But the games idea is built around the classic
# boad game Battleship. This will allow the user to place there ships randomly on a grid.
# the enemy you will take turn guessing where the ships are from a series of turn based 
# guesses that invold firing at certain grid coordinates. If the coordinates match up with
# a ships location then the ship is hit and you have gained insight on the ships location
# and gained a point in doing so.

# SNAKE GAME (UPDATED VERSION)
#
#
# Name: Cody Thompson
# Project: Snake Game
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# The idea beind this game is that the board will be created upon execution, then
# the user can select the difficulty from the menu that is presented to them at run time.
# Once a difficulty is selected then the game stats by having the snake move in a linear fashion
# then random red squares will appear that represent the food tokens. The user has to 
# move there snake using the arrow keys to pick p the food. Onced picked up the food token then
# turns into a segment of the snake thus extending the snakes body. Dont run into the walls on the
# sides or run into yourself as then the game will be over.
# UPDATES:
# added in a section that saves highscores to a file that is then read to output the highscores
# Added in a way to continue playing if game over is acheived.

# TOWER DEFENSE GAME(work in progress)
#
# Name: Cody Thompson
# Project: Tower Defence game
# Date: April 9, 2025
# Project Description:
# This game works by first populating a screen for the games run. Then,
# giving the user some option choose from in being the towers they wish to place.
# Once the first tower is placed then the game starts. When an enemy is killed the user
# gets points based upon how much that specified enemy is worth utilizing a dictionary to
# assign there values. If the enemy reaches the home base then the home base is decremented
# by 1. If the home base health reaches zero then the game ends.
